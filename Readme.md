# Readme
I built this application for a school project the rough outline was 
create a project with the knowledge that we had arrived at a functional application
and what I came up with was a computer parts application based on my love for 
computers.

computer part application I built allows a user to submit
apart from computer parts for client's wants, there are three inputs
- Part- which is the parts name, 
- year- which is the parts year of
manufacture, and 
- price- which is the parts price.

when these inputs creates a list of parts. the client can
also, remove items with the remove button that is represented by
a "x". In the top left conner is a toggle box, when clicked it causes the screen to go into dark-mode.

## Instructions for Application

1 - Download a local host server using install -g json-server
2 - Create a file within your terminal using touch db.json
3 - in the terminal cd into this file and type -json -sever --watch db.json
and press enter 
4 - The application should be good to go.


## WEBSIIE

The website I used is a local Api using my local machine as the host
using -json -sever --watch db.json you can use the server by downloading
npm install -g json-server in your terminal
